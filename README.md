# Responsive Cards
Using the [Learn Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FNNkzPBFcE) Youtube Channel tutorial I was able to create Responsive Cards.

Please click [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/responsive-cards/) to view the web page with the cards that I created using the Learn Web tutorial.

To create this I used [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) which compiles to generate the [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html).
